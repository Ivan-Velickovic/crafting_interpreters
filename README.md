# Crafting Interpeters Lox Implementation
This is my implementation of the language Lox as I go through the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com) (my implementation is mostly the same as the book with some minor changes).

Currently this repository contains the tree walk interpeter for Lox (jlox) written in Java.
