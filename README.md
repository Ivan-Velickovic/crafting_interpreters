# Crafting Interpeters Lox Implementation
This is my implementation of the language Lox as I go through the book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com) (my implementation is mostly the same as the book with some minor changes).

* `jlox`: Implementation of the tree-walk interpreter using Java (chapters 4 - 13).
* `clox`: Partial implementation of the bytecode virtual machine using C (chapters 14 - 21).
* `zlox`: Implementation of the bytecode virtual machine using Zig (chapters 14 - 30). I wanted to try
out Zig and decided to port what I had implemented in C and finish the book using Zig.
